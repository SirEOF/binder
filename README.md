This is a binder program that mimics what malware creators do to get users to run an executable file that seems
unharmful but actually runs the virus in the background. This was done for a network security class at CSUF for
educational purposes only. 

The python program gets the hexcode of the files and creates a c++ file. The c++ file has the hexcode and binds them
together so the files run at once.
